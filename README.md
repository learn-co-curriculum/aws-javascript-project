# JavaScript Mini Project Guidelines

## Introduction

Welcome to the JavaScript Mini Project!

Youâ€™ve worked so hard to get here and have learned a ton. Now it's time to bring
it all together on your own!

For this project, you will be given a local API served with `json-server` to build 
a frontend for. Your frontend should be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will
communicate with the given mock backend.

## CuteSpace

The project you will be building is an app for voting for the cutest animal. Use this gif as an example of how the app should work.

> Your styling does not have to match what is shown in the above example to pass. Feel free to add your own style! 

## Core Deliverables

When it comes to developing projects, a key concept to have in mind is the "Minimum Viable Product", or MVP for short. You should aim to meet the MVP requirements first. Doing so keeps your focus on completing a functional project first and foremost, avoiding any potential time loss on extraneous work. 

For this project, those requirements are listed below as user stories: 

**As a user, I can:** 

1. See each animal's name in a navigation bar. 
2. Click on each animal's name to display their details and photo. 
3. Click on a "Vote" button for a specific animal and immediately see their vote count increase. It should _not_ affect the amount of votes any other animal has. 

## Bonus Deliverables 

The following deliverables are **not** required as part of this project's MVP and will not affect your score. These are here if you finish early and want an extra challenge. Make sure you commit your work to save your progress before attempting the bonus deliverables!

**As a user, I can:** 

1. Click on a "Reset" button for a specific animal to reset their votes to 0. 
  - **Extra challenge:** Add a "Reset" button to reset _all_ animal's votes to 0. 
2. See a leaderboard of the animals ordered by descending vote count.
  - **Extra challenge:** Add a button that will toggle the order from descending to ascending vote count.
