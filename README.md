# JavaScript Mini Project Guidelines

## Introduction

Welcome to the JavaScript Mini Project!

Youâ€™ve worked so hard to get here and have learned a ton. Now it's time to bring
it all together on your own!

For this project, you will be given a local API served with `json-server` to build 
a frontend for. Your frontend should be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will
communicate with the given mock backend.

## CuteSpace

The project you will be building is an app for voting for the cutest animal. Use this gif as an example of how the app should work.

> Your styling does not have to match what is shown in the above example. Feel free to add your own style! 

## Core Deliverables

When it comes to developing projects, a key concept to have in mind is the "Minimum Viable Product", or MVP for short. You should aim to meet the MVP requirements first. Doing so keeps your focus on completing a functional project first and foremost, avoiding any potential time loss on extraneous work. 

For this project, those requirements are listed below as user stories: 

**As a user, I can:** 

1. See each animal's name in a navigation bar. 
2. Click on each animal's name to display their vote count and photo. 
3. Click on a "Vote" button for a specific animal and immediately see their vote count increase. 
    - It should _not_ affect the amount of votes any other animal has. 
    - For MVP, the update vote count does _not_ need to persist once you refresh or navigate away from that animal.

## Setup 

To allow you to focus on writing code, we've provided you with some starter code and all the files you will need. Fork and clone down the attached repository to get started.

### The Files 

The three files you should be working in are:

1. `index.html` 
2. `style.css` 
3. `src/index.js` 

The HTML file includes the boilerplate and links to both the CSS and JavaScript files. 

### The Mock Backend 

We've also provided you with the mock database to work with. To get it started, use `json-server` by running the following command: 

```sh
json-server --watch db.json
``` 

Test your server by visiting this route in the browser: 

[http://localhost:3000/animals](http://localhost:3000/animals)

Once that's up and running, you're good to start coding! Note that the base URL for your API will be [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). 

## Bonus Deliverables 

The following deliverables are **not** required as part of this project's MVP and will **not** negatively affect your score if you do not attempt them. These are only here if you finish MVP early and want an extra challenge. Make sure you commit your work to save your progress before attempting the bonus deliverables!

**As a user, I can:** 

1. Click on a "Reset" button for a specific animal to reset their votes to 0. 
  - **Extra challenge:** Add a "Reset" button to reset _all_ animal's votes to 0. 
1. Click on a "Vote" button for a specific animal and have the updated vote count persist.
  - **Hint:** You will need to make a `PATCH` request to `/animals/:id`
